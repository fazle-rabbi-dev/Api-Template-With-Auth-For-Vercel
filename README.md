A robust and versatile REST API template with the setup of Authentication and User Management to streamline the process of creating REST APIs using Express.js.

It eliminates the need to write authentication code, saving you valuable time and effort. This template serves as an excellent starting point for any API requiring authentication, providing a secure and efficient foundation.

- üåü Specially **designed to deploy on** [Vercel](https://vercel.com)

> [IMPORTANT]
> In this api every single file contains multiple components
instead of being modularized because this API
is designed to be deployed on Vercel. Vercel 
doesn't support more than 12 serverless 
functions, so to keep the JavaScript files under 12,
I designed the API code this way.


### üî¥ Unveiling the Journey of Building This Api-Template
> [!Note]
> I developed this REST API to simplify the creation of APIs that require authentication. By using this template, developers can avoid writing authentication code, allowing them to focus on other essential aspects of their projects. This solution provides a comprehensive and efficient approach to creating REST APIs with user authentication.

### `üåü This project was created using an Android phone`

### üì± Coding with Android is Amazing!

If you think you need a PC to start coding, think again! With just an Android phone, you can dive into the world of web and app development. Here‚Äôs a showcase of a project created entirely on an Android phone using Acode, Restler, and Termux.

### üîß Tools Used:
- **Acode**: A powerful code editor with features similar to VS Code, such as auto code completion, keyboard shortcuts, and theme customization.
- **Restler**: A REST API client for testing and debugging APIs similar to Postman.
- **Termux**: A terminal emulator for Android that allows you to run Linux commands and scripts.
- **Hacker's Keyboard**: A pc like Keyboard for Android that allows you to use commands like: Ctrl, Alt, F1, F2, (Up, Down, Right, Left Arrow) etc.

### üñºÔ∏è Screenshots:

</div> 

### üöÄ Why Coding with Android is Amazing:
- **Portability**: Code anytime, anywhere with just your phone.
- **Convenience**: No need to carry a laptop; everything you need is in your pocket.
- **Efficiency**: Get a lot done with minimal resources.

> [!Note]
> With the right tools, learning and developing on an Android phone is not only possible but also an incredibly rewarding experience. Start your coding journey now!
